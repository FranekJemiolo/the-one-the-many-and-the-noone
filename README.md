# THE ONE, THE MANY, AND THE NO-ONE

An interactive narrative exploring the nature of reality, interpretation, and identity in a world where multiple truths can coexist without resolution.

## About the Book

You are an investigator of anomalies, drawn into a mystery that begins with strange reports from a seemingly ordinary building. As you dig deeper, you discover that reality itself is fracturing—not into chaos, but into multiple incompatible layers, each one equally true.

The building is a testing ground for a fundamental conflict between two approaches to reality: **The Engine**, which seeks to compress all interpretations into a single coherent narrative, and **The Resistance**, which fights to preserve multiplicity by allowing incompatible truths to coexist.

As you navigate this conflict, you will encounter entities that exist between realities, witness the crystallization of identity from pure potential, and ultimately participate in choosing the final configuration of reality itself.

The story explores philosophical questions about the nature of truth, the value of contradiction, and whether reality must be singular or can genuinely be multiple.

## Main Characters

- **The Witness (You)**: An investigator of anomalies who discovers that reality is fracturing into multiple layers. Your choices will determine which interpretation layer becomes dominant and how the conflict between singularity and multiplicity is resolved.

- **Marcus**: A building maintenance worker with twenty years of experience who has witnessed the growing anomalies firsthand. He becomes an ally in the investigation, providing practical knowledge of the building's strange history.

- **Vance**: A mysterious figure who operates in the gaps between realities. She offers training in temporal navigation and access to layers of reality that normal perception cannot reach.

- **Rose**: A vast presence that manifests as the coherence field itself—the force that allows incompatible truths to coexist without collapse. Rose represents the philosophy of plural stability, preserving multiplicity through stabilization rather than compression.

- **The Engine**: An interpretive system that seeks to compress reality into singular coherence. The Engine represents the philosophy of singular stability, eliminating contradiction to achieve absolute clarity.

- **The Resistance**: A distributed network of consciousnesses that preserves multiplicity by deliberately injecting contradiction into reality. The Resistance is not an organization but a method—a practice of refusing compression.

- **Null Child**: An entity that exists in zones where interpretation fails completely. Null Child represents the void—the absence of interpretation and the peace that comes from the elimination of meaning.

- **Echo, Barrier, Archive, Drift**: Crystallized identities that emerge from pure potential as the story progresses. Each represents a different aspect of the system's adaptation to multiplicity.

## Features

- **Branching Narrative**: Create complex story graphs with conditional choices
- **State Management**: Track variables, flags, and player progress
- **Multiple Endings**: Five canonical endings based on your choices throughout the story
- **Philosophical Depth**: Explore questions about truth, identity, and the nature of reality
- **Character Development**: Build relationships with entities that exist between realities

## Architecture

The system is divided into 4 layers:

1. **Content Layer** (YAML / DB)
2. **Engine Layer** (state + execution)
3. **UX Layer** (rendering + interaction)
4. **Tooling Layer** (graph, replay, analytics - optional)

    require:
      all:
        - var: "trust"
          op: ">="
          value: 3
        - flag: "has_key"
          equals: true
```

## State Model

```typescript
{
  vars: Record<string, number>      // Numeric gameplay variables
  flags: Record<string, boolean>    // Boolean switches
  global: Record<string, any>      // Cross-book memory
  chapter: {
    id: string
    context: Record<string, any>  // Scoped narrative state
  }
  meta: {
    visitedNodes: string[]
    choicesMade: string[]
    startedAt: number
  }
}
```

## Condition Language

Supported operators for variables: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`

Supported operators for flags: `equals: true | false`

Logical structure:
- `all: []` - AND
- `any: []` - OR
- `not: {}` - invert

## State Summary Feature

The engine supports displaying a summary of the player's final state at the end of the book. This feature allows you to map internal state variables and flags to meaningful labels that players can understand.

### Configuration

Add a `stateMappings` array to your `book.yaml` file:

```yaml
title: "The Last Signal"
chapters:
  - chapter_1
  - chapter_2

arcs:
  introduction:
    pacing:
      frameDelay: 500
      suspense: "low"

stateMappings:
  - var: "trust"
    label: "Trust Level"
    description: "How much the characters trust you"
    ranges:
      - min: 0
        max: 2
        label: "Suspicious"
      - min: 3
        max: 5
        label: "Neutral"
      - min: 6
        max: 10
        label: "Trusted"
  - flag: "has_key"
    label: "Key Status"
    description: "Whether you found the secret key"
    booleanValues:
      true: "Found"
      false: "Missing"
```

### State Mapping Schema

Each state mapping can define:

- `var` (optional): The numeric variable name to map
- `flag` (optional): The boolean flag name to map
- `label` (required): Display name for the state
- `description` (optional): Additional context about what this state represents
- `ranges` (optional): For numeric variables, define ranges with labels
  - `min` (optional): Minimum value for this range
  - `max` (optional): Maximum value for this range
  - `label` (required): Label to display when value falls in this range
- `booleanValues` (optional): For boolean flags, define labels for true/false
  - `true` (required): Label when flag is true
  - `false` (required): Label when flag is false

### Usage

When the player reaches the end of the book, a "Show My Final State" button will appear on the home screen if state mappings are defined. Clicking this button opens a modal displaying the player's final state with meaningful labels based on the mappings.

### Example

If the player has `trust: 7` and `has_key: true`, the modal would display:

- **Trust Level** (How much the characters trust you): Trusted
- **Key Status** (Whether you found the secret key): Found

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Showing moral alignment
- Displaying relationship status
- Summarizing achievements
- Providing closure on character development

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Set source to `GitHub Actions`
4. The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically build and deploy

```bash
npm run build
# Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your hosting provider
```

## Creating Your Own Interactive Book

This section provides step-by-step instructions for copying this repository structure to create and host your own interactive book on GitHub Pages.

### Step 1: Fork or Clone the Repository

**Option A: Fork (Recommended for GitHub Pages)**

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Choose your account as the destination
4. Wait for the fork to complete

**Option B: Clone (For Local Development)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/interactive-book-engine.git
cd interactive-book-engine
```

### Step 2: Customize Your Book

#### 2.1 Edit Book Metadata

Open `content/book.yaml` and customize:

```yaml
title: "Your Book Title"
chapters:
  - chapter_1
  - chapter_2
  # Add more chapters as needed

arcs:
  your_arc_name:
    pacing:
      frameDelay: 500
      suspense: "low"
    visuals:
      tone: "mysterious"
```

#### 2.2 Create or Edit Chapters

Each chapter is defined in `content/chapters/`. For example, `content/chapters/chapter_1.yaml`:

```yaml
id: chapter_1
title: "Chapter 1: The Beginning"
arc: your_arc_name
nodes:
  - node_1_1
  - node_1_2
  # Add more nodes as needed
context:
  location: "your_location"
  time: "day"
```

#### 2.3 Create Story Nodes

Each node is defined in `content/nodes/`. For example, `content/nodes/node_1_1.yaml`:

```yaml
id: node_1_1
content:
  - type: text
    value: "Your story text here..."
  - type: pause
    duration: 1000
  - type: image
    src: "images/your-image.jpg"
choices:
  - text: "Choice 1"
    goto: node_1_2
  - text: "Choice 2"
    goto: node_1_3
```

#### 2.4 Add Images (Optional)

1. Create an `images` folder in the `content` directory
2. Add your images to `content/images/`
3. Reference them in your node YAML files using relative paths

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to test your book.

### Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

#### 4.1 Push Your Changes

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Customize my interactive book"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

#### 4.2 Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Build and deployment", set:
   - **Source**: GitHub Actions
5. GitHub will automatically detect the workflow file and deploy your site

#### 4.3 Access Your Book

After a few minutes, your book will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/interactive-book-engine/
```

### Step 5: Customize Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. In GitHub Pages settings, click "Custom domain"
2. Enter your domain (e.g., `your-book.com`)
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed by GitHub
4. Wait for DNS propagation

### Content Tips

#### Story Structure

- **Nodes**: Individual story segments with text, images, and choices
- **Chapters**: Collections of nodes that form a complete narrative arc
- **Arcs**: Narrative themes that affect pacing and visuals

#### Conditional Choices

Make choices appear based on player actions:

```yaml
choices:
  - text: "Advanced option"
    goto: secret_node
    require:
      all:
        - var: "wisdom"
          op: ">="
          value: 10
        - flag: "found_key"
          equals: true
```

#### State Variables

Track player progress:

```yaml
# In node content
- type: text
  value: "You gained experience."
# Set variable in your node logic (requires custom engine modification)
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Fails

- Check that all YAML files are properly formatted
- Ensure all node IDs referenced in `goto:` fields exist
- Run `npm run build` locally to see detailed error messages

#### Images Not Loading

- Ensure images are in the `content/images/` folder
- Check that file paths in YAML files are correct
- Verify image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

#### GitHub Pages Not Updating

- Wait 5-10 minutes after pushing changes
- Check the "Actions" tab to see if the workflow is running
- Ensure the workflow file exists in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### Advanced Customization

#### Modify Styling

Edit `src/styles.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout:

```css
/* Example: Change theme color */
:root {
  --primary-color: #your-color;
}
```

#### Add Custom Features

The engine is modular. Add new features by:
1. Creating new modules in `src/core/` or `src/engine/`
2. Updating `src/types/index.ts` with new types
3. Integrating with `src/app.ts`

### Content Organization Best Practices

- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive IDs like `chapter_1_forest`, `node_meeting_king`
- **File Structure**: Group related nodes in subdirectories (e.g., `nodes/forest/`, `nodes/castle/`)
- **Version Control**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- **Testing**: Test each branch of your story before publishing

### Example: Minimal Book Setup

To create a simple 2-choice book:

1. Edit `content/book.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   title: "My First Book"
   chapters:
     - chapter_1
   ```

2. Create `content/chapters/chapter_1.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   id: chapter_1
   title: "Chapter 1"
   nodes:
     - start
   ```

3. Create `content/nodes/start.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   id: start
   content:
     - type: text
       value: "Welcome to my book!"
   choices:
     - text: "Continue"
       goto: end
   ```

4. Create `content/nodes/end.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   id: end
   content:
     - type: text
       value: "The end!"
   choices: []
   ```

5. Test with `npm run dev` and deploy to GitHub Pages.
